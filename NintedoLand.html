          <h2>Nintendo SNES Console</h2>
          <p class="description">The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), also known as the Super NES or Super Nintendo, is a 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo that was released in 1990 in Japan and South Korea. In North America, the SNES became available two years later in 1991 as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System: Super Set and in 1992 in a trimmed down version called the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). In Europe and Australasia (PAL region), the console released in 1992. The SNES is Nintendo's second home console, following the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other consoles at the time. The SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era despite its relatively late start and the fierce competition it faced in North America and Europe from Sega's Genesis/Mega Drive console.</p>

      <h1>Super Mario World</h1>
      <p>Super Mario World is a 2D side-scrolling platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1990. The game was also re-released on the Game Boy Advance handheld console and the Wii, Wii U, and New Nintendo 3DS virtual consoles.
        <br>
        The game follows Mario and his dinosaur friend Yoshi as they travel through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from the clutches of Bowser, the game's antagonist. The game features a series of levels, most of which have multiple exits, and Mario and Yoshi must defeat enemies, collect power-ups, and navigate obstacles to progress through each level.
        <br>
        Super Mario World introduced several new gameplay mechanics, including the ability to store power-ups in a reserve item slot, the addition of Yoshi as a playable character, and the inclusion of secret exits and branching paths in levels. The game also features a world map that allows players to choose their own path through the game levels.
        <br>
        Super Mario World was both a commercial and critical success, selling over 20 million copies and receiving high praise for its graphics, sound design, and gameplay. The game is widely regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time and has been included on numerous "best games" lists over the years.</p>
